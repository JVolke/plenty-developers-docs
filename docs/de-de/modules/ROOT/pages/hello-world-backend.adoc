== Hello World Backend Tutorial


In this tutorial, we will develop a basic plugin to display a view in our plentymarkets backend. Only basic knowledge of creating and editing files in your IDE as well as using plentymarkets is necessary to develop this plugin.

Follow the steps and learn how to create your first view that displays Hello World! in the plentymarkets back end.

=== First File: plugin.json

The first thing that we are going to do is create a plugin.json, which contains all information about our plugin, that we need.

.plugin.json
[source,json]
----

{
    "name": "HelloWorld", <1>
    "description": "My first back end view", <2>
    "namespace": "HelloWorld", <3>
    "author": "Your name", <4>
    "type": "backend", <5>
    "serviceProvider": "HelloWorld\\Providers\\HelloWorldServiceProvider" <6>
}
----
<1> This is the name of our plugin. This is also how it will be displayed in the repository.
<2> A description for our plugin
<3> We recommend that you use the name of the plugin folder as the namespace root. This service provider is the central location to register services in the plugin.
<4> The Author of the plugin, your company name or your personal name.
<5> The type of the plugin, for now accept, that this is a template, there are also other type, which we will explain later.
<6> The namespace of our ServiceProvider (We haven't created it yet)


=== Second File: ui.json

Now we need a ui.json. This file defines the entries of our backend menu.

.ui.json
[source,json]
----
{
    "defaultEntryPoint": "index.html", <1>
    "namespace": "HelloWorld", <2>
    "menuEntries": [
        {
        "label": "Hello World", <3>
        "menu": "start", <4>
        "urlKey": "hello-world", <5>
        "entryPoint": "index.html" <6>
        }
    ]
}
----
<1> This is the name of our plugin. This is also how it will be displayed in the repository.
<2> The namespace of our ServiceProvider (We haven't created it yet)
<3> The label defines how it will be displayed in the menu.
<4> The menu, in which the menu entry is added.
<5> The url key, under which we open the menu point. (in our case this will be /start/hello-world
<6> The entryPoint basically tells us which file to open.


=== Folder Structure

Furthermore we will now present you the structure including all the files, that we will need for our Hello World Plugin.
So we only have to create the index.html, which will be a simple file and our ServiceProvider.

....
HelloWorld/ <1>
  resources/
    images/
      plentymarkets_graffiti.gif <2>
  src/
    Providers/
      HelloWorldServiceProvider.php
  ui/
    index.html <3>
  ui.json
  plugin.json
....
<1> We recommend calling your Folder the same way that you called your Plugin in the plugin.json
<2> A fancy gif image which we will display in the backend.
<3> We use a simple html file, called index.html to display our Hello World!


=== The Output

Let's define what we want to present the user, that comes to our specified route: In out case it's a simple Hello World.

.index.html
[source,html]
----
<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<img src="../images/plentymarkets_graffiti.gif">
----


=== Our ServiceProvider

This is a very basic Service Provider.


.HelloWorldServiceProvider.php
[source%linenums,php,linenums]
----
<?php

namespace HelloWorld\Providers;

use Plenty\Plugin\ServiceProvider;

class HelloWorldServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register()
    {

    }
}
----


=== Deploy the plugin and see the result

To deploy the plugin into the system you can folllow this <<hello-world-simple.adoc#deployplugin,guide>>.

Now you just need to go to this route in your backend
`/start/hello-world`

and you have the result.
