= Hello World Simple

[#helloworld]
== Hello World Frontend

=== A Simple Route

This tutorial is aimed at plentymarkets users who are getting started with plugin development. You will only need basic knowledge of creating and editing files in an integrated development environment (IDE) as well as using plentymarkets.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You need to prepare your computer to program a plugin. If you don't know how, please take a look link:index.html[here]!
Furthermore you should be able to use git and Github to publish your plugin. link:index.html[Here] you can find tutorials.

In a few simple steps, we will walk you through creating your first plugin that displays Hello World! in your browser when adding `/hello` to your domain.

.What an incredible technology!

There are often people who like to rush things, and if you are one of them. We totally understand. You can just download
the link:https://github.com/plentymarkets/plugin-hello-world2[github repository] in the master branch and try to figure yourself out what the code means. Otherwise, stay tuned and keep following the next 3 steps!


=== First File

The first thing that we are going to do is create a plugin.json, which contains all information about our plugin, that we need.
[source,json]
----
{
      "name":"HelloWorld", <1>
      "description":"My first plugin", <2>
      "namespace":"HelloWorld", <3>
      "author":"plentysystems AG", <4>
      "type":"template", <5>
      "serviceProvider":"HelloWorld\\Providers\\HelloWorldServiceProvider" <6>
}
----
<1> This is the name of our plugin. This is also how it will be displayed in the repository.
<2> A description for our plugin
<3> We recommend that you use the name of the plugin folder as the namespace root. This service provider is the central location to register services in the plugin.
<4> The Author of the plugin, your company name or your personal name.
<5> The type of the plugin, for now accept, that this is a template, there are also other type, which we will explain later.
<6> The namespace of our ServiceProvider (We haven't created it yet)



=== Folder Structure

Furthermore we will now present you the structure including all the files, that we will need for our Hello World Plugin.

....
HelloWorld/ <1>
  resources/
    views/
      content/
        hello.twig <2>
  src/
    Providers/
      HelloWorldRouteServiceProvider.php
      HelloWorldServiceProvider.php
    Controllers/
      ContentController.php
  plugin.json
....
<1> We recommend calling your Folder the same way that you called your Plugin in the plugin.json
<2> You can organize your twig templates in subfolders

==== Explanation of all Components

We need a few files to establish the possibility for communication between your plugin and plentymarkets.

- `HelloWorldServiceProvider.php` is our ServiceProvider. It is needed to register the plugin within the plentymarkets backend.

- `HelloWorldRouteServiceProvider.php` is our RouteServiceProvider. It creates and registers the output route.

- `ContentController.php` renders and displays the content in your template. For us this will be the `hello.twig`


==== Our Output

Let's define what we want to present the user, that comes to our specified route: In out case it's a simple Hello World.

.hello.twig
[source,html]
----
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
----


==== Real Coding

So let's take a look at the Files, that actually do something. We will paste the Source Code and write Explanations to
specific code Fragments.

.ContentController.php
[source%linenums,php,linenums]
----
<?php
namespace HelloWorld\Controllers;

use Plenty\Plugin\Controller;
use Plenty\Plugin\Templates\Twig;

/**
 * Class ContentController
 * @package HelloWorld\Controllers
 */
class ContentController extends Controller
{
	/**
	 * @param Twig $twig
	 * @return string
	 */
	public function sayHello(Twig $twig):string <1>
	{
		return $twig->render('HelloWorld::content.hello');
	}
}
----

<1> In this code example, we define the `sayHello` function that renders a twig template. The render method specifies the template location: `'PLUGINNAME::TEMPLATE'`. Since templates are always saved in the resources/views folder in your plugin, we only have to specify part of the template path. Note that `PLUGINNAME` is the name of the plugin folder. The name of the plugin folder and the plugin namespace may differ.

.HelloWorldRouteServiceProvider.php
[source%linenums,php,linenums]
----
<?php
namespace HelloWorld\Providers;

use Plenty\Plugin\RouteServiceProvider;
use Plenty\Plugin\Routing\Router;

/**
 * Class HelloWorldRouteServiceProvider
 * @package HelloWorld\Providers
 */
class HelloWorldRouteServiceProvider extends RouteServiceProvider
{
	/**
	 * @param Router $router
	 */
	public function map(Router $router)
	{
		$router->get('hello', 'HelloWorld\Controllers\ContentController@sayHello'); <1>
	}

}
----

<1> We use the get method to pass two parameters. The first parameter 'hello' defines the route. The second parameter consists of the Fully-Qualified Class Name and the @ controller method that is called when the route is called.



.HelloWorldServiceProvider.php
[source%linenums,php,linenums]
----
<?php
namespace HelloWorld\Providers;

use Plenty\Plugin\ServiceProvider;

/**
 * Class HelloWorldServiceProvider
 * @package HelloWorld\Providers
 */
class HelloWorldServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{

	/**
	 * Register the service provider.
	 */
	public function register()
	{
		$this->getApplication()->register(HelloWorldRouteServiceProvider::class); <1>
	}
}
----

<1> This line registers the `HelloWorldRouteServiceProvider` with our application. This means the RouteServiceProvider will map our route to your plentyshop. Therefore the circle is complete. Coding is done ðŸ˜Ž. Commit your repository to your github repo.
