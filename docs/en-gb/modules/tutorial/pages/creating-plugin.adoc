= Creating a plugin

Throughout the tutorial, you will create a plugin that displays items to promote in your store.
Start by creating a basic plugin and deploying it in plentymarkets.

This page covers the following steps:

* Installing Node.js
* Installing a plugin generator
* Creating a new plugin
* Deploying your plugin in plentymarkets

== Installing the plugin generator

You can create new plugins by running a plugin generator.
To install the generator, you need an active version of Node.js.
You can check if you have Node.js installed, open a terminal and run the following command:

[source]
----
$ node --version
----

If you have Node.js installed, it'll show the currently active version:

[source]
----
$ node --version
14.15.3
----

If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from link:https://nodejs.org/en/download/[nodejs.org^].

After installing Node.js, you're ready to install the plugin generator.
To install the generator, run the following command:

[source]
----
$ npm i -g yo @plentymarkets/generator-plugin
----

Now you can create your plugin.

== Creating the plugin

To create your first plugin, carry out the following steps:

. Open the command line.
. Navigate to the plugin set folder in your workspace.
. Run the following commands:

$ mkdir TopItems
$ cd TopItems
$ yo @plentymarkets/plugin

. Follow the prompts of the generator.
